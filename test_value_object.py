Value Object
Whenever we have a business concept that has data but no identity, we often choose to represent 
it using the Value Object pattern. A value object is any domain object that is uniquely identified by 
the data it holds; we usually make them immutable.

One of the nice things that dataclasses (or namedtuples) give us is value equality, 
which is the fancy way of saying, "Two lines with the same orderid, sku, and qty are equal."
'''
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Name:
    first_name: str
    surname: str

class MoneyTuple(NamedTuple):
    currency: str
    value: int

Line = namedtuple('Line', ['sku', 'qty'])


def test_equality():
    assert MoneyTuple('gbp', 10) == MoneyTuple('gbp', 10)
    assert Name('Harry', 'Percival') != Name('Bob', 'Gregory')
    assert Line('RED-CHAIR', 5) == Line('RED-CHAIR', 5)

These value objects match our real-world intuition about how their values work. 
It doesn't matter which Â£10 note we're talking about, because they all have the same value. 
Likewise, two names are equal if both the first and last names match; and two lines are equivalent 
if they have the same customer order, product code, and quantity. 
We can still have complex behavior on a value object, though. 
In fact, it's common to support operations on values; for example, mathematical operators:
